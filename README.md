# myvimconfig

This repository contains the best configuration for vim editor that worked for me. You can try it out.



Here are the steps on how to setup this up:


1. Install vundle using following command:

   ```git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim```

   vim now supports downloading plugins from GitHub repositories.

2. Copy paste this .vimrc in your $HOME directory of unix/linux machine.

3. Open .vimrc and run command ":PluginInstall".

4. Wait for the installation to complete and exit the file. (It might take time if you are downloading plugins from GitHub.)

5. Open any file and see the magic happening.




As of today, this custom installation contains:


1. Light & Dark Vim color schemes inspired by Google's Material Design
2. Buffer Tabs
3. Dockerfile syntax highlighting
